- Implement *@props on every constructor to emulate the C sub. Constructors would simply do:
	for @props.rotor(2) -> ($m, $v) { $o."$m"() = $v }
  ... where $o is the object being created.
- Refactor ModelItem and CanvasItem properties into associated roles, since
  there do not seem to be much in the way of differences. If there are,
	differences in the implementation between model and item, then those should
	be removed from the role and implemented, separately.
